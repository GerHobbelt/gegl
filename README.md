# GEGL (Generic Graphics Library)

GEGL (Generic Graphics Library) is a data flow based image processing framework, providing floating point processing and non-destructive image processing capabilities to GNU Image Manipulation Program and other projects (imgflo, GNOME Photos, iconographer, …​)

With GEGL you chain together processing operations to represent the desired image processing pipeline. GEGL provides operations for image loading and storing, color adjustments, GIMPs artistic filters and more forms of image processing GEGL can be used on the command-line with the same syntax that can be used for creating processing flows interactively with text from GIMP using gegl-graph.
